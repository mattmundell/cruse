BUILDING AND INSTALLING CRUSE
=============================

0) Requirements

   Libncurses (or perhaps some other Curses library), Python and SWIG
   are required.

   The CERN libraries are required if the CERN demo is enabled.  In
   Debian these are libkernlib, libmathlib and libgraflib.  The
   development machine is running the 2004.01.20-1 versions.

   The MP expression evaluation addition requires GMP and the expr
   demo library.  The expr library is included in the GMP distribution
   (GMP 4.1.4 on the development machine).  The expr library can be
   compiled by running `make allprogs' in directory demos/expr/ and
   installed by copying expr.h to /usr/local/include and libexpr.a to
   /usr/local/lib.

   The PPL example requires PPL (http://www.cs.unipr.it/ppl/), which
   requires GMP.  Cruse, PPL and GMP all need to compiled by the same
   compiler.

1) Makefile.config may need to be adapted to the target system,
   especially the PYVERSION and PYFLAGS variables.  If the CERN, GMP
   or PPL directives are present then the CERN, MP expression
   evaluation and PPL additions will be included, respectively.

2) Running `make' builds the program.  Warnings are likely.

3) The src directory will contain the executable `cruse', and can be
   included on the system path as installation.

   Try this for simple examples: src/cruse python/small_eg.py

   Try this to see extending with Python: src/cruse python/editing.py

4) `make clean' cleans the entire tree, including the executable.
