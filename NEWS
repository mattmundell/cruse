New in Cruse:									-*- outline -*-

* Version 0.0.9  (January 8, 2022)
==================================

** Get it building on recent system


* Version 0.0.8  (May 14, 2006)
===============================

** The -fPIC argument, in the C++ flags

** Linking of the shared library to the CERN libraries only if required

** `#include <cstdio>' style includes (vs #include <stdio.h>)

** Better handling of the mode line when it is longer than the window width
   Corrects wrapping of the mode line, and sometimes program
   termination, when the mode line is longer than the width of the
   window.

** Echoing of the names of any exceptions thrown during the display loop


* Version 0.0.7  (December 16, 2004)
====================================

** A few changes to correct compilation under g++ 3.4


* Version 0.0.6  (December 8, 2004)
===================================

** Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) example
   C-cp echoes a description of the polyhedron defined (in PPL ascii
   dump format) by the current buffer.  "test/ppl-*" are example
   files.  "etc/shot-ppl.png" is a screen shot.  Presence in build
   determined by the "PPL" directive.


* Version 0.0.5  (December 4, 2004)
===================================

** Multiple precision integer expression evaluation
   C-ci evaluates the MP expression on the current line using GMP's
   "expr" demo library.  The result is echoed.  Examples in
   "test/gmp".  "etc/shot-gmp.png" is a screen shot.  Presence in
   build determined by the "GMP" directive.


* Version 0.0.4  (November 18, 2004)
====================================

** A small CERN library demo
   C-cr writes a 1000 pairs of random numbers at point, and C-cg
   displays distribution graphs of the numbers.  There's a screen shot
   of the graphs in "etc/shot-cern.png".

** Better display adjustment after point moves out of the window
   Specifically, the window includes point after yanking of large
   amounts of text, and after swapping point and mark across the edges
   of the window.


* Version 0.0.3
===============

** CommandLine improvements
   Member functions used directly, instead of wrapper functions.

** Dynamic key binding
   Keys are bindable from Python with bind_key and bind_sequence.

** Python extensions transpose_chars (C-t) and transpose_lines (C-x C-t)

** Correct clip_word (M-d) behaviour when point is at the end of a word

** File etc/KEYS
   A list of the initial key bindings.


* Version 0.0.2
===============

Corrected some movement errors.  Improved directory structure.  Better
access to the editor objects from Python, hence M-d clips a word using
a Python function.  Key bindings are still static though.


* Version 0.0.1
===============

More movement and editing key bindings.  The mark, and a clip list,
for clipping, copying and yanking.  A start at extensibility with
Python.  Now called Cruse.


* Version 0.0
=============

Initial version.  Very basic editing.  Static key bindings.  Uses
ncurses for display.
